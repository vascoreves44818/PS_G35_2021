# Force Direct Visualization for Phylogenetic Trees
**Force Direct Visualization for Phylogenetic Trees** is a cross-platform desktop app, build on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), for phylogeneric tree visualization. Also available to be used in applications such as PHYLOVIZ.
This project focuses on a non static visualization of phylogenetic trees, Force Directed Layout, build using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
The application is a modular soluction build using Javascript, Handlebars, HTML and CSS.

## Force Directed Layout 

**Force direct layout**, is a algorithm for graphic visualization in the browser. This algorithm is based on a physical model, simulating physical forces among the set of edges and nodes,based on their relative positions and using this forces to simulate movement. Thenodes are represented by points that repel each other like magnets resulting in as few crossingedges as possible. This algorithm receives as input a phylogenetic tree in either Newick or nexus format and the profile and isolated data.
